Citi Bike is the largest bike-share program in the United States, with 20,000 bikes and over 1,300 pick-up stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Jersey City.
Through the Citi Bike app, they are able to gather loads of useful data which, when analyzed, reveals great insights into things like user demographics and behavior.
So, my mission is to analyze data collected by Citi Bike
and help to make data-driven decisions based on the insights my uncover.
