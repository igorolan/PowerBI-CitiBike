Product recommendations:

Install more bikes at Grove St Path, Sip Ave, Newport Path, Newark Ave, Van Vorst Park. 
Make more bikes available in autumn, as this is when Citi Bike users take the longest trips (which means bikes will be unavailable for longer)


Marketing recommendations:

The Citi Bike customer base is mostly long-term subscribers aged between 35-44, who are most active during the week. This tells us that they are probably people who live in New York and use Citi Bikes to commute. Marketing and advertising campaigns should therefore target this particular demographic.
